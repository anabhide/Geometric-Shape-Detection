# Geometric-Shape-Detection

I have used 3 ML algorithms to train a model that can detect the geometric shape present in the image with some random text noise:
1.	Logistic Regression with Softmax
2.	MLP (multi-layer perceptron) classification
3.	CNN (convolutional neural network)

For more details and analysis please refer to the Project Report.
